# Example: VideoGAN Trajectory Prediction

## Finding
Model operates in liquid regime on normal traffic.
Frozen regime triggered under occlusion and rare events.

## Certificate
R = camera field of view  
C = training dataset size  
Regime = frozen under OOD  
Action = abstain / slow / request sensing
