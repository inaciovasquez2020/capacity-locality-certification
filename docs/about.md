## About
The **Capacity–Locality Certification (CLC)** project provides a deterministic framework for the structural certification of predictive systems. By mapping information capacity against locality limits, the protocol identifies the precise mathematical boundaries where a system must abstain from inference to maintain reliability.

This work is part of the **Unified Rigidity Framework (URF)**, focused on ensuring that machine logic remains grounded in local-global manifold stability.
