# Executive Summary — Capacity–Locality Certification

Modern AI systems often produce confident predictions even when the situation
does not contain enough information to justify them.

The Capacity–Locality Certification (CLC) standard defines:
- when a system is allowed to predict,
- when it must abstain,
- and how this decision is certified.

The key principle is simple:
If a system only sees a limited part of the world and has limited information
capacity, then some predictions are structurally unreliable in principle.

CLC does not attempt to make predictions better.
It certifies when prediction is **not allowed**.

This enables:
- safer autonomous systems,
- auditable AI decisions,
- regulatory compliance,
- and reduced liability.
