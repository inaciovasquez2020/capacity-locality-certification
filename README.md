# Capacity–Locality Certification (CLC)

Structural certification framework for predictive systems under information capacity and locality limits.

This repository contains:

- **Theory** — certified-limits note (docs/papers/certified-limits-note.md)  
- **Whitepaper** — industry whitepaper (docs/whitepapers/clc-whitepaper.md)  
- **Specification** — NDGate and certificate schemas (docs/spec/*.md)  
- **Examples** — templates and sample certificate (docs/examples/*.md)  
- **Executive summary** — plain-English intro (docs/EXECUTIVE.md)

This also serves as the basis for the public reference site:

## What is CLC?

CLC defines when an AI predictive system is:
- **Allowed to predict** (liquid regime),  
- **Required to abstain** (frozen regime),  
- And how to produce a machine-readable **certificate** of that determination.

It is intended as a **public reference standard**, not tied to any architecture or vendor.
