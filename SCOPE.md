# Scope of the CLC Standard

This standard applies to any predictive system operating under:
- local observation,
- bounded information capacity,
- refinement-based inference.

It does not certify correctness of predictions.
It certifies **when prediction is structurally unreliable**.

The only normative requirement is:
systems must abstain in the frozen regime.
